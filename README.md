# Robotic Anxiety Support Cat Onboard Software System

## RASCOSS: pronounced "rask"-"ose")

Designed through a cross-disciplinary coalition of students, the RASC system seeks out to
provide the benefits of having an anxiety support car without the typical issues involved with a support cat
(namely unpredictability and potential allergins, etc).
